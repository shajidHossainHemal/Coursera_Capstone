# Coursera_Capstone
This project is from Coursera's Applied Data Science Capstone course offered by IBM. This course includes a Coursera course certificate also an IBM digital badge upon successful completion of the course.  

This project uses location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare. Then it makes RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world. Also this project includes creative solutions if data are not readily available by scraping web data and parsing HTML code. This project utilizes Python and its pandas library to manipulate, explore and analyze data. 

Finally, the Folium library is used to generate maps of geospatial data and to communicate the results and findings.
